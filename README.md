# Puc-Rio

My projects for Computer Engineering classes. Each folder is named after the disciple's code, with it's full name available in the [README] file. <img src="Images/githubparrot.gif" width="35" height="35"/>

## Eng1000 - Introduction Engineering 📓

The main goal of this project was to create a [PID controller] using [Arduino]. In my case, I created a program to handle temperature changes by increasing and decreasing the voltage on a computer fan in order to cool a house prototype.

## Inf1018 - Basic Software 📓

* [T1][1] - [converte_utf.c][3] is a program in C to convert UTF-8 files into UTF-16 and back, UTF-16 into UTF-8.
* [T2][2] - [Compila.c][4] is a program in C to compile a simple made up programming language

## Inf1301 - Modular Programming 📓

In this [class][7] my group and I were tasked with creating a Freecell game.

## Inf1019 - Computer Systems 📓

* [T1][5] - Routine in C to simulate how a processor handles different incoming processes.
* [T2][6] - Routine in C made to simulate a page table.

## Inf1383 - Databases 1 📓

The goal of this [class][8] was to create and populate a Postgres database to illustrate a real life situation.

## Inf1636 - Object Oriented Programming 📓

This classe's goal was to teach object oriented programming. To better illustrate how a project can be done using object oriented programming, I was tasked with recreating the popular [Monopoly (Banco Imobiliário)](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Imobili%C3%A1rio) game.
